# Yoga by Delphine website

This is the website for [yogabydelphine.com](http://www.yogabydelphine.com/).

You can book online and in-studio yoga courses (only available in french).

This site is based on a JAMSTACK architecture:

- [GatsbyJS](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/): a static site generator
- [Shopify](https://www.shopify.com/) for the e-commerce part
- [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) for CI/CD/hosting
- [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/) to manage images
- [Tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/)

## How does it work?

Performance and accessibility are essential for this project. That's the reason why I rely on a static site generator such as Gatsby. The challenge is to manage dynamic data (courses).

The key idea of this architecture is the use of webhooks. I define webhooks to trigger builds on Netlify when a course is created/updated/deleted on Shopify.
