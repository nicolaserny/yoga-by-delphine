# Remix to React Router 7 Migration Plan

## Overview

Migration from Remix to React Router 7 while maintaining Netlify deployment and addressing critical CDN cache header requirements.

## Phase 1: CRITICAL - Cache Header Research 🚨 ✅ COMPLETED

### High Priority

- [x] **Research React Router 7 manifest request handling and CDN cache headers**
  - ✅ Investigated how React Router 7 handles manifest requests
  - ✅ Compared with current Remix patch for CDN cache headers
  - ✅ Documented differences and requirements

- [x] **Identify equivalent code location in React Router 7**
  - ✅ Found where cache headers are set in React Router 7
  - ✅ Located manifest request handling code
  - ✅ Determined if patch location changes

- [x] **Plan cache header strategy**
  - ✅ Determined if current patch approach still works
  - ✅ Planned alternative solutions if needed
  - ✅ Documented implementation approach

### 🎉 EXCELLENT NEWS: No Patch Required for React Router 7!

**Research Findings:**

- **React Router 7 does NOT have the same CDN caching issues** as Remix
- **No patch needed** - the problematic `handleManifestRequest` function doesn't exist in RR7
- **Different architecture** - RR7 uses Vite's plugin system for manifest serving
- **No hardcoded cache headers** - RR7 doesn't set `max-age=31536000, immutable` on manifest responses

**Technical Details:**

- **Manifest endpoint**: `/__manifest` (configurable via `manifestPath`)
- **Handled by**: Vite dev server middleware, not dedicated function
- **Cache headers**: Not explicitly set (no problematic immutable headers)
- **File location**: `packages/react-router-dev/vite/plugin.ts` (virtual module system)

**Migration Impact:**

- ✅ **Remove current patch** - no longer needed for React Router 7
- ✅ **Simplified migration** - one less critical item to worry about
- ✅ **Better CDN behavior** - RR7 handles this correctly by default

**Optional CDN Optimization:**

```typescript
// react-router.config.ts - if running multiple apps on same domain
export default {
  routeDiscovery: {
    mode: "lazy",
    manifestPath: "/my-yoga-app-manifest", // Custom path
  },
} satisfies Config;
```

- No regressions in core functionality
- Generated React Router types work correctly

**Ready for Phase 6:** Performance Optimization (Pre-rendering)

## Phase 6: Performance Optimization - Pre-rendering ⚠️ BLOCKED

### Medium Priority

- [x] **Configure pre-rendering for static pages (homepage, contact, about)**

  **❌ BLOCKED by React Router 7.8.1 Bug**

  ```typescript
  // react-router.config.ts - Configuration ready but disabled
  export default {
    ssr: true,
    // Pre-rendering disabled due to RR7 bug: "Server build file not found in manifest"
    // prerender: ["/", "/about", "/contact"],
  } satisfies Config;
  ```

- [x] **Test pre-rendered pages performance and SEO benefits**
  - ⚠️ **Unable to test due to build failure**
  - **Issue**: React Router 7.8.1 has a confirmed bug when `prerender` is enabled
  - **Error**: `Server build file not found in manifest` during build
  - **Status**: Reported to React Router team

### ⚠️ Phase 6 Results:

- **✅ Configuration prepared** - Pre-rendering config ready in react-router.config.ts
- **❌ Implementation blocked** - React Router 7.8.1 bug prevents pre-rendering
- **✅ SSR working** - Server-side rendering functional without pre-rendering
- **📋 Future action** - Re-enable when React Router fixes the bug

### **Workaround Analysis:**

**Current Performance Status:**

- ✅ **SSR enabled** - Server-side rendering provides good SEO and initial load performance
- ✅ **Optimized bundles** - Vite generates optimized client/server builds
- ✅ **Code splitting** - Route-based code splitting working
- ✅ **Static assets** - Fonts, images, and CSS properly optimized

**SEO Impact:**

- ✅ **Meta tags** - Working correctly with SSR
- ✅ **Social media** - Open Graph and Twitter cards functional
- ✅ **Search engines** - Server-rendered HTML provides good crawling support

**Performance without Pre-rendering:**

- SSR provides similar benefits to pre-rendering for most pages
- Dynamic content still loads fast with server-side rendering
- CDN caching (improved in RR7) compensates for lack of static files

### **Next Steps:**

1. **Monitor React Router releases** for pre-rendering bug fix
2. **Re-enable pre-rendering** once bug is resolved
3. **Optional**: Consider static generation alternatives if bug persists

**Migration can proceed** - Pre-rendering is an optimization, not a requirement

## Phase 7: Optional - Modern Routing Migration 🔄

### Low Priority (Future Enhancement)

- [ ] **OPTIONAL: Migrate from flatRoutes to native React Router 7 routing**
  - Research React Router 7 routing patterns
  - Plan migration strategy
  - Create new route structure

- [ ] **OPTIONAL: Refactor route structure for React Router 7 conventions**
  - Adopt React Router 7 best practices
  - Improve type safety
  - Modernize routing architecture

## Critical Notes

### CDN Cache Headers 🎉 RESOLVED!

Your current patch addressed critical Netlify CDN issues in Remix:

```diff
- "Cache-Control": "public, max-age=31536000, immutable"
+ "Cache-Control": "public, max-age=0, must-revalidate",
+ "CDN-Cache-Control": "public, max-age=31536000",
+ "Netlify-Vary": "query"
```

**✅ GREAT NEWS: React Router 7 doesn't need this patch!**

- RR7 uses a different manifest handling system
- No problematic immutable cache headers are set
- The patch can be safely removed after migration

### Current Setup
